# groovy-clone

This is my awful attempt at remaking groovy. With all of its features (including premium ones) which are all usable for free

Pricing basic features for your bot is utterly stupid which is why i decided to make this, and also since the original groovy no longer exists

Also keep in mind that the bot may still be very buggy. And do not expect it to be online 24/7
